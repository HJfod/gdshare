 * If you run into problems, send a message to HJfod#1795 on Discord or open an [Issue](https://github.com/HJfod/gdshare/issues) here!

### Usage

When opening the app, it will present you with a tutorial that will walk you through the essential features. If you need more help though, you can click the `Help` buttons in each section to view specific help!

### FAQ

 * If you'd like to use GDShare on a GDPS (Private Server), go to Settings > General > Advanced and change your GD data location

### Features

* Create & manage local backups of your Geometry Dash data! (Even automatically!)
 * Export & import Geometry Dash levels as files!

### Shortcomings

Because we're not trying to claim this is an ideal app, here's a list of potential issues.

 * This is only available on Windows. I have looked into creating an Android version, but unfortunately that is impossible due to Android security.
 * The app may (and likely does) contain bugs.

### Contribution

Unfortunately, as I am totally clueless about how GitHub contributions work, if you'd like to work on this, send me a Discord DM at HJfod#1795 and I'll be sure to add you to our development group chat.
