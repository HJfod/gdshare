GDShare is an application for Geometry Dash meant to provide easy and secure tools for collab hosts and creators.

###Features:
 * Create & manage local backups of your Geometry Dash data! (Even automatically!)
 * Export & import Geometry Dash levels as files!

###Shortcomings:

Because we're not trying to claim this is an ideal app, here's a list of potential issues.

 * This is only available on Windows. I have looked into creating an Android version, but unfortunately that is impossible due to Android security.
 * The app may (and likely does) contain bugs.
